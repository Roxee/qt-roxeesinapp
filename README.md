# DuboSinApp

> "Dubo Components" are lightweight, targeted c++ libraries meant for QT applications.
> They aim at providing *simple to use* interfaces for a range of functionality
(notification, crash reporting, zero conf, application update, torrent, etc).
> Fully scriptable, they are primarily meant for javascript (from a QWebEngine) - thought they are usable as well in plain QT.
> Put together, these components should provide a comprehensive foundation for these building a "WebRunner", similarly to Electron.

DuboSinApp provides a "single instance" application.
Trying to start another instance will instead focus the existing one.
